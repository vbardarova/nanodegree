## The Libraries That I Have Used <a name="libraries"></a>

The project was implemented using Anaconda distribution of Python 3.6. 
The following python libraries were used: NLTK, NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Sklearn

## My Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

In this project,the Seattle Airbnb open dataset 2016-2017 from Kaggle is used to discover a few key aspects of the Airbnb renting scene in Seattle. The information can be used to help potential hosts assess the price they can charge based on the facilities they provide.

A few questions this project seeks to answer are:

1. What's the sentiment around the guest reviews?
2. Do superhosts have better and more positive reviews?
3. What neighbouthoods have more positive and less positive reviews?
4. What are the key features which determine listing prices?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The Jupyter notebook showcases the analysis done in order to explore the dataset,.

Lastly, the seattle folder contains the dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle).
