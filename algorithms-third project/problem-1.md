# Problem 1: 

Calculated the floored square root of a number using binary search to solve the problem. The values of i * i is monotonically increasing, so the problem can be solved using binary search.

Time complexity: O(log n).
The time complexity of binary search is O(log n).

Space Complexity: O(1).
Constant extra space is needed.
