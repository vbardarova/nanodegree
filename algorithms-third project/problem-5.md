# Problem 5 

Having created a tree structure Trie, we keep track of all childs by using dictionaries. This dictionary uses the letters of the alphabed as keys. We have the ability to insert a character or return all suffixes for existing words in the trie.

```
TrieNode
time complexity and space complexity to insert a character is O(1).
time complexity and space complexity of suffixes of a node is O(M*N).

Trie
time complexity and space complexity to insert a word is O(n).
time complexity to find a prefix is O(n) and space complexity is O(1).
```
