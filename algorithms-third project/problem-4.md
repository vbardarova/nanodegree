# Problem 4

The algorithm here is recursion. We check whether the name of the group is tha same as the user, next we check what's the users list of that group. Next, we proceed at the child groups. Depending on whether we find any users, we return True or False

    
```
Time Complexity: O(the number of users)
Space Complexity: O(n)
```
