# Problem 7 

We first initilised a RouteTrieNode with value and handler as reference to next node, followed by a root node to implement RouteTrie

RouteTrieNode's time complexity and space complexity both are O(M*N).

RouteTrie's time complexity and space complexity both for lookup and add handler is O(n).
