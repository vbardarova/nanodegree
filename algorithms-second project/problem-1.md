# Problem 1: Least Recently Used Cache

We have used OrderDict to assign values for specific keys. The algorithm will get the value if it's existent.The algorithm will attempt assigning value but will pop the last one if the list is at capacity.

Time Complexity: o(1) for both set and get
Space Complexity:O(n)
