# Problem 3

The algorithm calculates the number of times each character appears in a string. The character with the highest occursnce is encoded with a minimum code lenght, ie 1, then next character as 01 and then 001 and so on
```
Time Complexity: O(nlog(b))
Space Complexity: O(number of characters)
```
